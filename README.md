# predator-prey-dynamics

In a conda environment, where FEniCS is installed you can run the code via:

`python pred_pey.py 1 0.1 0.01` 

where the first argument is the prey-taxis coefficient $\kappa$, the second argument is the diffusion coefficient of the predator $\nu$
and the third argument is the diffusion coefficient of the prey $\mu$.

All other parameters of the system and the simulation need to be changed within the script.
